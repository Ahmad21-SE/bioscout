Common birds in the Margalla Hills include the Himalayan Bulbul, Indian Paradise Flycatcher, White-throated Kingfisher, and Yellow-billed Blue Magpie.
These birds are often spotted in forested trails and open grassy areas.

The best time for birdwatching is early morning or late afternoon when birds are most active.
