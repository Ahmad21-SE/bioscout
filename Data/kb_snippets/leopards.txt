Leopards (Panthera pardus) have been seen near Daman-e-Koh, Trail 4, and Monal Road at night.
The Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) recommends that visitors hike in groups and avoid venturing into dense forest areas after sunset.

Camera traps have recorded leopard movement patterns, especially during winter months.
